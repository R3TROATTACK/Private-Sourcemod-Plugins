# Trouble In Terrorist Town

## What is TTT

Trouble in terrorist town was a game mode created by Bad King Urgrain for gmod. It was later ported to CSGO by [Franc1sco](<https://github.com/Franc1sco>) and was publicly released by [Bara](<https://github.com/Bara>). Since the public release I've always maintained my own separate version of TTT to make it more similar to gmod TTT. I attempted several rewrites of the plugin up until 2020 when I finally finished recreating it from scratch.

TTT is a game mode where there are three different roles that are randomly assigned at the start of every round. First you have your traitors whose goal is to kill every non-traitor. Next you have innocents who are just regular players who hae no special advantages over other players. Lastly you have detectives who are basically buffed innocents. Innocents and detectives need to work together to kill the traitors. Traitors and detectives each have access to a special menu where they can buy items that will hopefully give themselves an better chance at winning.
