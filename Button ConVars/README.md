# Button ConVars

## What is Button ConVars?

Button ConVars is a plugin that I wrote for one of my old minigame servers, but could technically be used in any game mode. The plugin sets convars to a specified value when the button is pressed and resets them to their previous value when the round ends.

## Features

- Have convars run when button is pressed
- Fully in-game configuration
